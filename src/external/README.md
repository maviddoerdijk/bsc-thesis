# External
This folder will hold all repos that are externally sourced.

## time_moe
I expect this will stay the only folder actually found here. I need to be able to import the logic from the repo inside my own repo.

Though the code is originally cloned from `https://github.com/Time-MoE/Time-MoE` into the folder `time_moe`, it will not be tracked separately by git inside time_moe, just the same as all other files.
